Program Mini using MicroPython:

Given the hardware resource requirements to implement the MicroPython firmware, an ESP8266 microcontroller is used to load the firmware.

RX and TX pins of the VSDSquadronMini are used to automate communication with the ESP8266 along with other GPIOs as required.

MicroPython code written on VSCode implements on the ESP8266 microcontroller which inturn drives the VSDSquadronMini.

Hence, VSDSquadronMini is essentially controlled using MicroPython.
